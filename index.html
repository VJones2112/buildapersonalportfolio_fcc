    <h2>About Veronica</h2>
    <p>Hi friends! I am a former teacher turned web developer. I taught middle school math for 11 years but I knew it was time to leave that profession for the last two years. My heart was in it but my stress could not be controlled.</p>
    <p>When Covid sent us all home starting mid-March 2020, I started coding relentlessly. I had done a couple of Codecademy lessons previously and really enjoyed it, but teaching does not leave time for personal pursuits. However, I took the change of pace Covid gave us as an opportunity to dig in. I started coding daily using Codecademy, freecodecamp, Udemy Courses, the Odin Project, and YouTube tutorials. About two months in, I feel confident in my html and css abilities but am trudging through javascript. I just need to find my groove in JS. At this point, I'm dreaming about divs!</p>
